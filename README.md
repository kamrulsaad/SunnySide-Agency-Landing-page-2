## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/scss


### What I learned

This was my first aproach to learn sass, the css preprocessor. I had known the basics of sass but this is the first project I used it in. I gladly thank #amirehman, by help of whose video I could implicate all the works done on sass. Check out his [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/amirehman/sunnyside-agency-landing-page) to learn more from him.

### Continued development
